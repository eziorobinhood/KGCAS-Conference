                <h5>Prof . Peter. M. Atkinson,<br> Professor  & Dean,
                    <br> Faculty of Science and Technology<br> Lancaster University,<br>Engineering Building<br>LA1 4YR<br>Lancaster<br>Director Emai-ID :<a href=" pma@lancaster.ac.uk"> pma@lancaster.ac.uk</a></h5>
                <p>Professor Peter M. Atkinson is Executive Dean of the Faculty of Science and Technology at Lancaster University, a role he has held since 2015. He was previously Executive Dean of the Faculty of Health and Medicine (a role he held simultaneously with being Executive Dean of FST, 2018-19) at Lancaster. Peter was also Chair of the University's successful Athena SWAN institutional submission (2018-19).

                    Previously, Peter was Head of School (Geography) at the University of Southampton (2007-12), an executive role with full budgetary responsibility. Following this, at Southampton Peter was Director REF Strategy (the academic lead for Southampton's REF2014 submission).
                    Peter is a Distinguished Professor of Spatial Data Science at Lancaster University, and an interdisciplinary scientist. Specifically, Peter's research involves the application of space-time statistics and geostatistics, machine learning and AI, and dynamic numerical modeling, to Earth observation (EO) and other spatio-temporal data, to answer a wide range of science and social science questions.

These interdisciplinary science questions relate to understanding:
<ul>
<li>Spatial and space-time sampling effects, including change of scale and the change-of-support-problem (CoSP)</li>
<li>Disease transmission systems, especially communicable diseases such as influenza and COVID-19 and vector-borne disease systems such as malaria and Trypanosomiasis</li>
<li>Global vegetation, phenological and land cover changes in response to anthropogenic and climate changes</li>
<li>Natural hazard impacts and risks, including flooding, landsliding and near-Earth object (asteroid) impacts</li></ul>
